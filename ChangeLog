2006-12-17	Version 0.3
	o Fixed a bug which caused dead links when browsing Bibles with
	  non-English locales where Bible book names contains non-ascii
	  characters 
	o Fixed a bug with 'Test settings' where previous URL contained 
	  non-ascii characters
	o Fixed a bug which caused searching for non-ascii characters to
	  fail 
	o Changed documentation license for the sake of Debian
	o Other small improvements and code cleanups

2006-01-06	Version 0.2
	o Better support for Bibles in RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew)
	o Supports localised names for books of the Bible
	o New, simplified page design using cleaner and better HTML (no tables, 
	  semantic HTML)
	o Settings propagate in URLs, so you can turn a setting on and it stays
	  on (and this works even if multiple kio_sword processes are spawned)
	o Access keys for navigation and toggling formatting settings
	o Title of the page is meaningful (much better for browsing history in
	  Konqueror)
	o New shortcut for Bible verses: e.g. sword:John 3:16 (note there is no
	  forward slash after "sword:") to go to your default Bible
	o Lots of cleaning up of the code, including a new system for settings
	  and output of HTML, using namespaces nicely and naming classes 
	  sensibly :-)
	o Search page pre-selects the default Bible as the module to search
	o Fixed various bugs

2004-06-05	Version 0.1

	o  removed nulls in HTML output
	o  make umlauts display properly in GerSch (for example)
	o  removed some debug code
	o  HTML/CSS changes:
		o if you've made a customised version of the 
		  kio_sword.css file, you'll need to remove 
		  it or merge changes in by hand for things 
		  to look right
		o added <div class='sword_text'> around
	          all the main body of text returned from 
		  a module
		o navigation links formatted as inline list
		o changed class names sword_xxx to swordxxx
		  for CSS2 correctness
