Feedback/votes for any of these are appreciated - e-mail the author.
Bugs are summarised at the end.

===================
After release 0.1:
===================
o  Currently the modules names are case sensitive - case insensitive 
   would be good.

o  HTML
	- move to XHTML strict
	- simplify HTML
	- create it consistently, and using placeholders

o  Style sheet
   o have a system stylesheet base.css
   o have an additional user stylesheet:
     - automatically search the kio_sword dirs for CSS files,
       and allow the user to choose one
   o Still allow the default.css to be overridden by a copy in users
     dir, but not the suggested way of doing it.  Instead,
     include the user.css file after default.css, so it overrides
     anyway.  This way when a new version is installed, new style sheet
     changes will be included
   o package an 'empty' user.css file -- contains various selectors, with
     comments, but no actual content


o add some nice CSS to do formatting

o  Read some config defaults from the BibleTime settings

o  Headings in Lexicons - use the proper name, not the user's query text 

o  Strongs and morph tags:
   o  these won't work properly in all modules yet. In GBF, all
      strongs hrefs go to greekstrongs - I need to look up some docs to 
      about the markup.

o  footnotes

o  ThML cross refs - partic MHC - have tags that just specify a verse number or
   verse and chapter, the rest of the reference should be inferred by the context
   (e.g. in commentary on John 5, '2' means John 5:2).  We need to get these to
   produce correct hrefs

o  Lots of i18n issues:
   o  Support for non-English names for Bible books
      o in terms of querying e.g. sword:/KJV/Gen√®se  ??
      o and for displaying the book name
      (not sure how this will work)
   o  Ability to choose different fonts for diferent lanugages somehow
      o  probably by adding <span class='sword_hebrew'> </span>
         and using CSS, if possible
   o  Need to investigate these issues:
      o reading of supplied URL - what encoding is it in?
      o construction of URL for redirection, or going back
        to previous page - encoding issues?
   o  add dir=RTL|LTR and lang attributes according to the user's chosen
language

o  BUG: Bibles that don't have e.g. OT should produce an error if you request
  an OT verse

o  Return an appropriate title for the text being browsed and put between the
   <title></title> tags, so that you can bookmark pages with a meaningful title

o  clean up/standardise the way we do initialising of HTML fragments.

o  clean up/optimise lots of code according to the 'KDE mistakes' tutorial

o  improve docbook documentation

o  Do HTML encoding on URLs that are generated

o  Shortcut for accessing default module, perhaps by providing a search
provider (web shortcut) for 'bible'

o  'Bookmark' icon to make kio-sword pages appear with their own bookmark

=============================
Possible changes/new features
=============================

o  Possible:  instead of returning QStrings from CSword functions, pass them
   some kind of iostream object they can write to directly, which calls SlaveBase::data(),
   and so return the page as it is being generated.  This would be especially 
   important with searches
   o in reality, SWORD's search function returns all the results at once, so there is 
     no advantage in this - you have to wait for the function to complete
  
o  For searches, fork a thread off which then
   waits for SlaveBase::wasKilled(), and calls CSword::cancelSearch(), which in turn
   sets the SWModule::terminateSearch boolean. (problem - how do we get hold
   of the SWModule object CSword::search() is using?)
   o  Also report %age status of searches - this could be done using the same
      method:
        CSword::search() sets a call back when calling SWModule::search() which sets
        a data member of CSword with the %age completion.  Our thread which monitors
        for wasKilled() also checks this variable and calls SlaveBase::processPercent()
        so that Konqueror's progress bar will display the %age of the searching done

o  'Edit stylesheet' option ?? 
     o  Should pull in system kio_sword.css file or user's modified version
        into a <textarea>, allow editing and then save to ~/.kde/share/apps/kio_sword
   
     
 
======
 BUGS
======
 o  no thread safety/re-entrancy! Multiple simultaneous get requests to a single
    kio-sword process will likely cause incorrect results/crashes.  However 1) you
    wouldn't normally want to do this for kio-sword 2) doing it in Konqueror seems quite
    difficult - it always spawns another kio_sword process if the previous one has not 
    returned.
    Maybe this means I don't need to support this, but I need to find out.
    
 o  i18n issues described above
 
 o  Lots of the cross refs from MHC to the bible have incorrect links
