KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES
=================
o  Lots of the filters are incomplete, and don't render everything
   correctly, especially:
   o  footnotes
   o  cross references
   o  lemmas

o  i18n: Support for RTL text in the main page

o  Support for RTL modules that aren't Bibles

o  footnotes - not implemented at all yet

o  ThML cross refs - partic MHC - have tags that just specify a verse number or
   verse and chapter, the rest of the reference should be inferred by the context
   (e.g. in commentary on John 5, '2' means John 5:2).  We need to get these to
   produce correct hrefs

o  Strongs and morph tags:
   o  these won't work properly in all modules yet. In GBF, all
      strongs hrefs go to greekstrongs - I need to look up some docs to 
      about the markup.


o  Lots of i18n issues:
   o  Support for non-English names for Bible books
      o in terms of querying e.g. sword:/KJV/Gen√®se  ??
      o and for displaying the book name
      (not sure how this will work)
   o  Ability to choose different fonts for diferent lanugages somehow
      o  probably by adding <span class='sword_hebrew'> </span>
         and using CSS, if possible
   o  Need to investigate these issues:
      o reading of supplied URL - what encoding is it in?
      o construction of URL for redirection, or going back
        to previous page - encoding issues?
   o  add dir=RTL|LTR and lang attributes according to the user's chosen
      language


o  Bibles that don't have e.g. OT should produce an error if you request
   an OT verse

o  Luther's commentary on Galatians lists everything from Galatians -
   Rev  in the index.  Probably others similarly

POSSIBLE FEATURES/CHANGES
=========================

o  Make modules names case insensitive

o  HTML
	- move to XHTML strict

o  Style sheet
	- get someone to do a better design for the page

o  Read some config defaults from the BibleTime settings

o  Headings in Lexicons - use the proper name, not the user's query text 

o  clean up/optimise lots of code according to the 'KDE mistakes' tutorial

o  improve docbook documentation

o  'Bookmark' icon to make kio-sword pages appear with their own bookmark
