===================
After release 0.1:
===================
Lots of i18n issues:
--------------------
 o  Support for Non- Left-to-Right modules
 o  Support for non-English names for Bible books (maybe this works already?)
    o in terms of querying
    o and for displaying the book name
 o  Ability to choose different fonts for diferent lanugages somehow

Also
o  Perhaps: Make some attempt to propogate options specified in the URL into
   URLS generated by pages  (e.g. sword:/KJV/John?vn=0 should produce
   an index with URLs like  sword:/KJV/John 1?vn=0 etc)

o  Documentation - should appear in the Info Center, plus be able to
   link to it from quick help page. 

o  BUG: Bibles that don't have e.g. OT should produce an error if you request
  an OT verse
     
 ===================
   Even later
 ===================
 
 o  proper docbook documentation
